Cassandra [(link to website here)](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) is an open-source, key-value database NoSQL database.
As a key-value model, Cassandra structures its data with distinct keys that can correspond to sime or complex compound objects. 
Cassandra uses a cloud hosting model, built to handle large amounts of data across multiple data centers and the cloud. 
This means it's scalable and has no single point of failure. To access Cassandra, Java users must download the JDBC Cassandra driver.
