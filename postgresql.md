PostgreSQL [(link to website here)](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
As an RDBMS, PostgreSQL stores its data in the form of relations, or tables.
In addition to being a relational database, it also supports some of the features of object databases, making it an object-relational database.
PostgreSQL uses a client-server model, so users must use a database server in order for it to setup and run over a network. 
For Java to access it, users must download a PostgreSQL JDBC driver to connect Java to the PostgreSQL database server.
