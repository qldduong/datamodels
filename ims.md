IBM's Information Management System (IMS) [(link to website here)](https://www.ibm.com/products/ims) is a commercial, hierarchical database management system.
As a hierarchical database, it stores data in a tree-like structure that's built around parent-child relationships of the nodes within the tree.
IBM IMS uses a hybrid cloud model, so it uses on-premises storage and cloud storage.
Java applications can IMS databases and process IMS transactions through drivers like The IMS Universal drivers.
