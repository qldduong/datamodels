The Raima Database Manager (RDM) [(link to website here}](https://raima.com/product-overview/) is a commercial, relational database management system (RDBMS).
As a relational database, RDM stores its information in a table-like structure. 
RDM use an embedded hosting model, which means that the database runs within the same process as the code for efficient in-memory database use. 
Java requires users to download RDM JDBC drivers to write database applications and execute SQL statements with the RDM database.
The RDM drivers would give acess to functions that do things like creating and maintaining a connection to the database, and
deliver the database response back to the Java program.
