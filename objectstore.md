ObjectStore [(link to website here)](https://ignitetech.com/softwarelibrary/objectstore) is a commercial object database.
As an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS), ObjectStore allows users to combine database and object-oriented programming language capabilities.
ObjectStore can be hosted through the server-client model or over the cloud model. 
This means that the database will either run on a server in a local network, or over the Internet. 
To use ObjectStore, Java users must import a package like COM.odi. Java aplications must create a session before they can use any of the ObjectStore API.
