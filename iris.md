InterSystems IRIS [(link to website here)](https://www.intersystems.com/resources/intersystems-iris-data-platform-flexible-cloud-deployment-options/) is a commercial, multi-model database where data can be accessed as objects, documents, tables, key-value paris, or arrays.
This allows users to easily access data as various model types without abstraction layers or replication between models.
IRIS uses a cloud hosting model, allowing its data to be stored and processed across a variety of services on a variety of virtual and physical clusters.
Java users can access IRIS with the JDBC Iris driver. Once downloaded, the driver acts as a bridge between Java and the IRIS database.
JDBC drivers usually include functionality like creating and maintaining a connection to a database, send commands to that database, and
Deliver the database response back to our program.
The IRIS driver would connect Java to the database through functions like 1) maintaing a connection to the IRIS database and 
2) allowing users to send commands directly to the IRIS database through Java.
