Apache Hbase [(link to website here)](https://hbase.apache.org/) is a columnar, open-source database.
As a columnar database, it stores data  in individual columns, and each item is indexed by a unique row key. 
This strucutre allows facilitaties quick retrieval of individual.columns and efficient scans over individual columns in a table.
Hbase is uses a cloud hosting model, meaning that the database runs on servers connected to clients across the Internet.
HBase is written in Java and has a Java Native API. Therefore it provides programmatic access to Data Manipulation Language (DML).
This allows users to directly access data through Java using the same underlying communication protocol used by JDBC and SQL.
