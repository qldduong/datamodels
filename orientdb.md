OrientDB [(link to website here)](http://orientdb.org/) is an open-source, multi-model database management system.
It is a multi-model database, supporting graph, document, key-value, and object models (though relationships are managed as they are in graph databases).
OrientDB can be cloud hosted,but traditionally follows a client-server hosting model. 
It means that the server listens to remote commands from the client and executes them against the Orient databases. 
OrientDB is written completely in the Java language, so Java users can access it through JAVA APIs without needing to install any additional drivers or adapters.
